# How to Open the Draw.io File

## Method 1: Direct Upload (Recommended)

2. **Go to**: https://app.diagrams.net/
3. **Click**: "Open Existing Diagram" button
4. **Select**: "Device" (or "From Device")
5. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\PC\Downloads\Github Folders 2\`
6. **Select**: `corrected_architecture_final.drawio`
7. **Click**: "Open"

## Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. **Open**: https://app.diagrams.net/ in your browser
2. **Open File Explorer** (Windows key + E)
3. **Navigate to**: `C:\Users\PC\Downloads\Github Folders 2\`
4. **Drag** `corrected_architecture_final.drawio` **onto** the draw.io webpage

2. **Double-click**: `corrected_architecture_final.drawio`
3. If draw.io desktop app is installed, it will open

## If You Get Errors:

### Error: "d.setId is not a function"
- This might be a compatibility issue
- Try **Method 2 (Drag and Drop)** instead
- Or create a new diagram and copy elements manually

### File Won't Open
- Make sure you're using the **latest version** of draw.io
- Try **clearing browser cache** and trying again
- Use **Chrome or Edge** browser (best compatibility)

## Alternative: Create New Diagram

If the file still won't open, you can:
1. Create a **new diagram** in draw.io
2. Use the architecture description from `CORRECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` as reference
3. Rebuild the diagram manually (this gives you full control)

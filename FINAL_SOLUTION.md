# Final Solution: Architecture Diagram

Since the draw.io files aren't opening, here are your options:

## Option 1: Try This Minimal File (NEW)

Try opening: **`architecture_simple.drawio`**

This uses the absolute minimal XML structure. If this still doesn't work, use Option 2.

## Option 2: Build Manually (RECOMMENDED)

I've created a complete step-by-step guide: **`ARCHITECTURE_TEXT_GUIDE.md`**

This guide has:
- ✅ Complete text layout
- ✅ Exact colors and positions
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ All dimensions and details
- ✅ Box-by-box building guide

**This will definitely work** because you're building it directly in draw.io!

## Option 3: Export as Text/Image

If you need it immediately, I can create:
- A text-based ASCII diagram
- An image description you can use as reference
- A markdown file with the structure

Would you like me to create any of these alternatives?

## What I Recommend:

1. **Try `architecture_simple.drawio` first** (simplest XML format)
2. **If that fails, use `ARCHITECTURE_TEXT_GUIDE.md`** to build manually
3. Building manually gives you full control and ensures it works

The manual build should take about 10-15 minutes and you'll have a perfect diagram!
